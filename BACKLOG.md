# 808 backlog

One list, so nothing said in a session is lost between sessions. Newest at
the top of each section. Move a line, never delete it: DONE lines are the
record. (Melvin, 2026-09-12: "I am saying a lot and not finishing much.")

## Decided, not started

- **AirPods as the heart-rate source** (Melvin's friend, 2026-09-12). AirPods
  Pro 3 and Powerbeats Pro 2 carry an optical heart-rate sensor and iOS 26
  exposes it to apps through HealthKit during a workout. Paired with head
  motion from `CMHeadphoneMotionManager` (stillness, maybe breathing), that
  is a second no-Watch path beside camera vision. Investigate: what a
  phone-only `HKWorkoutSession` receives from the buds, and whether head
  motion carries a breath. Owner: unassigned.

- **Otto, the data interpreter** (Melvin, 2026-09-12). A chat you can ask
  about your own sessions: heart rate, stillness, breathing, the score, and
  meditation knowledge generally. Speaks in "the data suggests", never a
  medical claim, never a diagnosis. Named Otto (the name hiding in 8-0-8).
  Architecture decision recorded in CLAUDE.md: **on-device first** (Apple's
  Foundation Models framework, iOS 26, Apple Intelligence devices), because
  sending heart-rate data to a third-party model is the exact thing
  guideline 5.1.3 forbids without explicit consent and changed privacy labels,
  and because we told App Review there is no AI service in the app. Knowledge
  comes from our own bundled sources (SCIENCE.md, the guide, the score sheet)
  fed as context, not from training. Older devices get an honest "Otto needs
  iOS 26" card. Needs: a mockup first (Aziz's rule), the guardrail prompt,
  the disclaimer copy, a review of App Privacy answers even for on-device.
- **Guided sessions in more lengths** (tester feedback, 2026-09-12). 10, 15
  and 20 minutes beside the 25. Cheapest honest path: commission Donny for
  cuts of the same script; then a length picker on the Guided card.
- **AI coach voice library** (Melvin's wedge). ON HOLD: ElevenLabs was tried
  and "is not there yet". When it is, the first version is a pre-generated
  library by length and voice, offline, no runtime generation. Not before.
- **Friends** (Search tab placeholder). Needs a backend; the username is
  cosmetic until then and must not be presented as reserved.
- **Camera-vision sessions** (branch `camera-vision`): the answer to no-Watch
  churn. Ground truth is the bottleneck; the in-app collector exists.
- **Rating prompt is in 1.0.1.** Watch the ratings count in the launch
  scorecard.
- **Handle for the coach's name** (the narrated guide, not Otto): open.
  Candidates offered: Eight, Cadence, Tempo, Coach 808.

## In flight

- **1.0.1** (airplane-mode hole closed, rating prompt): archived, upload and
  submission are Melvin's.
- **1.0.2** (five tabs, username, Restore + Redeem, first-feedback fixes,
  mindful minutes): on `mvp`, on the beta, waiting on Melvin's test.

## Done (2026-09-12)

- "Give us feedback" in Settings: opens Mail to support@meditate808.com with
  the version and build already in the body.
- "Heart Rate" in title case on the results graph and its mirrors.
- 808 Beta crash at launch: the DEBUG CloudKit probe guessed a container it
  was not entitled to; it now reads the embedded profile. Beta 202609121726.
- Average heart rate on the heart panel ("79 → 54 bpm · avg 62").

- Reflections save themselves; gold Save button.
- "How is this scored?" link under the ring.
- "Guided meditation" as a technique; guided sessions pre-tagged.
- "First time meditating" lost its question mark.
- Do Not Disturb tip on the setup screen (no API exists to switch it on).
- Share sheet leads with the system sheet; Instagram is secondary.
- Mindful minutes written to Health per session; policy updated.
- Five-tab layout, username in onboarding, Membership section in Settings.
- Airplane-mode premium hole closed; 1.0.1 archived.
- Launch plan, PDF, website switched to the App Store, offer codes explained.
- CloudKit Production schema promoted (Aziz).
